# Sales_Analysis
This project helped us understand how Python can be used to study supermarket sales data in a simple way.

How it works:

 • Uploaded CSV in Google Colab
 
 • Used Python to read the file
 
 • Calculated total sales (Quantity × Price)
 
 • Found total revenue
 
 • Found top-selling product
 
 • Analyzed category-wise performance
